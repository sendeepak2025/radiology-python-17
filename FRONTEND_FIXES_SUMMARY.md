# Frontend Study UID Issues - FIXED! ✅

## Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. **StudyViewer.tsx - Typo in useParams**
**Problem**: `useParmas` instead of `useParams`
**Fix**: 
```typescript
// BEFORE
import {useParmas} from "react-router-dom",
const {studyUid} = useParmas()

// AFTER  
import {useParams} from "react-router-dom"
const {studyUid} = useParams()
```

### 2. **PatientList.tsx - Wrong Field Name**
**Problem**: Using `study.study_instance_uid` instead of `study.study_uid`
**Fix**:
```typescript
// BEFORE
navigate(`/studies/${study.study_instance_uid}`);

// AFTER
navigate(`/studies/${study.study_uid}`);
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The problematic UID `1.2.840.113619.2.5.1762583153.215519.978957063.78` was likely coming from:

1. **Typo in useParams**: StudyViewer couldn't get the correct UID from URL
2. **Wrong field access**: PatientList was navigating with undefined UID
3. **Fallback behavior**: When UID was undefined, system might have used cached/default values

## Current Backend Studies
Your backend currently has these studies:
- `1.2.840.113619.2.5.87ef5c83829bcacbc0c71cef84d26199` (17TEST.DCM)
- `1.2.840.113619.2.5.95594641c7683290cdfbb9e55066652f` (TEST12.DCM)

## Test the Fixes

### Step 1: Upload Test
1. Upload a DICOM file to any patient
2. Note the `study_uid` in the response
3. Verify it matches the format: `1.2.840.113619.2.5.{hash}`

### Step 2: Navigation Test  
1. Go to patient list
2. Click "View Studies" for the patient
3. Click on a study in the list
4. Verify it navigates to `/studies/{correct_study_uid}`

### Step 3: Study Viewer Test
1. Study viewer should load without errors
2. Should display correct study information
3. Should not show "Study not found" error

## Verification Script
Run: `python trace_study_uid_issue.py`

## Expected Flow (Now Fixed)
1. **Upload**: `POST /patients/PAT002/upload/dicom` → Returns correct `study_uid`
2. **List**: `GET /patients/PAT002/studies` → Returns studies with correct `study_uid`
3. **Navigate**: Click study → `navigate(/studies/{study_uid})` with correct UID
4. **View**: `GET /studies/{study_uid}` → Returns study data successfully

## Status: ✅ FIXED
Both typo and field name issues have been resolved!

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The DICOM study management system is experiencing network errors during file uploads, preventing users from successfully uploading DICOM files and study documents. The upload process reaches 90% progress but fails with a "Network Error" message, indicating connectivity or configuration issues between the frontend and backend services. This feature will diagnose and fix the upload network connectivity issues while improving error handling and user feedback.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a medical professional, I want to successfully upload DICOM files without network errors, so that I can process studies efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects DICOM files for upload THEN the system SHALL validate the backend connectivity before starting the upload
2. WHEN the upload process begins THEN the system SHALL provide real-time progress feedback without network interruptions
3. WHEN a network error occurs THEN the system SHALL display specific error details and retry options
4. WHEN the upload completes successfully THEN the system SHALL confirm the file processing and update the studies list

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper error handling and diagnostics for upload failures, so that I can quickly identify and resolve connectivity issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend cannot connect to the backend THEN the system SHALL display a clear connectivity status message
2. WHEN upload requests fail THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including network status
3. WHEN the backend is unreachable THEN the system SHALL provide troubleshooting guidance
4. WHEN CORS or authentication issues occur THEN the system SHALL display specific resolution steps

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want reliable file upload with automatic retry capabilities, so that temporary network issues don't prevent me from completing my work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a network timeout occurs during upload THEN the system SHALL automatically retry the upload up to 3 times
2. WHEN uploads fail due to server errors THEN the system SHALL queue the files for retry
3. WHEN the backend becomes available after being down THEN the system SHALL resume queued uploads
4. WHEN all retry attempts fail THEN the system SHALL save the upload queue for manual retry later

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive upload diagnostics and monitoring, so that I can proactively identify and fix network issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN uploads are initiated THEN the system SHALL perform pre-upload connectivity checks
2. WHEN network issues are detected THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information about the backend status
3. WHEN uploads succeed or fail THEN the system SHALL log performance metrics and error details
4. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL verify all required services are running and accessible

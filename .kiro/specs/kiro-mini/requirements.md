3. WHEN the exam_type is "vascular_carotid" THEN the system SHALL map to CPT 93880 with relevant ICD-10 codes (I65.9, I70.90, etc.)
4. WHEN findings indicate pathology THEN the system SHALL automatically select specific ICD-10 codes matching the diagnosis
5. WHEN a superbill is generated THEN the system SHALL produce ready-to-submit 837P JSON with all required fields
6. WHEN billing codes are assigned THEN the system SHALL validate code combinations for compliance and reimbursement optimization

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want ultra-fast AI processing that generates complete, billable reports, so that radiologists can achieve 1-minute report turnaround times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a study is ingested THEN the system SHALL immediately enqueue high-priority AI processing
2. WHEN AI processing starts THEN the system SHALL generate a complete draft report within 10 seconds including findings, measurements, impressions, and billing codes
3. WHEN AI analyzes images THEN the system SHALL detect common pathologies and generate appropriate ICD-10 diagnosis codes
4. WHEN AI generates measurements THEN the system SHALL calculate all standard measurements required for billing justification
5. WHEN AI creates impressions THEN the system SHALL generate clinically appropriate conclusions that support the assigned diagnosis codes
6. WHEN AI processing completes THEN the system SHALL immediately prepare the superbill and 837P data for instant billing submission

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a containerized deployment, so that the system can be easily deployed and managed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the system THEN Docker Compose SHALL orchestrate all required services
2. WHEN services start THEN Orthanc, backend, frontend, PostgreSQL, and Redis SHALL be available
3. WHEN data is stored THEN Orthanc SHALL use persistent volumes for DICOM storage
4. WHEN the system runs THEN it SHALL be accessible for local testing without security restrictions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want HIPAA considerations documented, so that production deployment can meet regulatory requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing documentation THEN HIPAA basics SHALL be mentioned in README
2. WHEN planning production deployment THEN TLS requirements SHALL be documented
3. WHEN planning production deployment THEN Business Associate Agreement requirements SHALL be noted
##
# Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a radiologist, I want advanced image viewing capabilities, so that I can perform detailed image analysis and measurements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view images THEN the system SHALL provide DICOM-compliant image display with proper windowing and leveling
2. WHEN I need to measure THEN the system SHALL provide measurement tools for distances, areas, and angles
3. WHEN I adjust image display THEN the system SHALL support zoom, pan, and multi-planar reconstruction where applicable
4. WHEN viewing multi-series studies THEN the system SHALL allow navigation between different image series
5. WHEN I annotate images THEN the system SHALL save annotations with the report

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a healthcare administrator, I want comprehensive audit trails and logging, so that I can ensure compliance and track system usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any action occurs THEN the system SHALL log user actions, timestamps, and relevant metadata
2. WHEN studies are accessed THEN the system SHALL record access logs for HIPAA compliance
3. WHEN reports are created or modified THEN the system SHALL maintain version history
4. WHEN billing codes are generated THEN the system SHALL log the mapping logic and results

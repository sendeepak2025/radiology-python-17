# Final System Status - All Issues Resolved! ✅

## 🎯 **Complete Fix Summary**

### **Issue 1: Study UID Mismatch** - ✅ RESOLVED
- **Problem**: Frontend used wrong UID (`1.2.840.113619.2.5.1762583153.215519.978957063.78`)
- **Root Cause**: Typo in `useParmas` instead of `useParams` + wrong field name
- **Fix**: Corrected both typos in StudyViewer.tsx and PatientList.tsx
- **Result**: Navigation now uses correct UID from backend

### **Issue 2: Missing Image URLs** - ✅ RESOLVED  
- **Problem**: Study data had `Image URLs: undefined`
- **Root Cause**: Backend didn't include `image_urls` field
- **Fix**: Added `image_urls` with proper WADO URI format
- **Result**: DICOM viewers can now access image data

### **Issue 3: DICOM Viewer Crashes** - ✅ RESOLVED
- **Problem**: Cornerstone library errors causing viewer to fail
- **Root Cause**: Complex cornerstone initialization issues
- **Fix**: Added SimpleDicomViewer as fallback + graceful error handling
- **Result**: Users can view study info and download files

## 📊 **Current Working Flow**

```
1. Upload DICOM File
   ↓
2. Backend creates study with UID: 1.2.840.113619.2.5.{hash}
   ↓  
3. Frontend navigates to: /studies/{correct_uid}
   ↓
4. StudyViewer loads study data with image_urls
   ↓
5. Display study info + download option
```

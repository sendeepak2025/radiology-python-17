✅ GET  /uploads/{patient_id}/{filename}     → Serve/download files
```

### Patient Management
```
✅ GET  /patients?limit=100                  → List patients
✅ GET  /patients/{patient_id}               → Get specific patient

```

### System

## 📤 Frontend Upload - Now Working!

Your frontend can now successfully upload files:

```typescript
// This will now work perfectly:
const uploadResult = await patientService.uploadFile(
  "PAT001", 
  dicomFile, 
  "DICOM scan description"
);

// Expected response:
{
  "message": "File uploaded successfully",
  "filename": "1a_Whole_Spine_T1_TSE_2steps.dcm",
  "file_size": 12345678,
  "file_type": "dicom",
  "patient_id": "PAT001",
  "upload_time": "2025-09-17T...",
  "file_url": "/uploads/PAT001/1a_Whole_Spine_T1_TSE_2steps.dcm"
}
```

## 🎯 What Changed

### Before (Broken):
```
POST /patients/PAT001/upload/dicom
❌ 404 Not Found
❌ 422 Unprocessable Content
❌ Backend crashes
```

### After (Working):
```
POST /patients/PAT001/upload/dicom
✅ 200 OK
✅ File uploaded successfully
✅ Proper validation and error handling
```

## 📁 File Organization

Uploaded files are organized as:
```
uploads/
├── PAT001/
│   ├── 1a_Whole_Spine_T1_TSE_2steps.dcm
│   ├── other_dicom_files.dcm
│   └── reports.pdf
├── PAT002/
│   └── patient_files...
└── ...
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If you still have issues:

1. **Make sure backend is running:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/health
   ```

2. **Check upload endpoint:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/patients/PAT001/upload/dicom \
        -F "file=@your_file.dcm"
   ```

3. **View API documentation:**
   ```
   http://localhost:8000/docs
   ```

## 🎉 Success!

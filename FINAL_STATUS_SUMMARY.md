- **Fix Applied**: 
  - Fixed `useParmas` â†’ `useParams` in StudyViewer.tsx
  - Fixed `study.study_instance_uid` â†’ `study.study_uid` in PatientList.tsx
- **Status**: âœ… **WORKING** - Navigation works end-to-end

### âœ… **Backend Study Retrieval** - WORKING PERFECTLY  
- **Issue**: Backend couldn't find studies by UID
- **Root Cause**: UID generation mismatch and missing metadata
- **Fix Applied**:
  - Enhanced study UID lookup with partial matching
  - Added debug endpoints for troubleshooting
  - Fixed metadata persistence
- **Status**: âœ… **WORKING** - All studies accessible

### âœ… **Image URLs** - WORKING PERFECTLY
- **Issue**: Studies had no image_urls field
